Perfect! I've broken down the complex single-file Flutter code into a well-organized, modular project structure. Here's what I've created:
📁 Project Structure Overview:
🎯 Core Files:

main.dart - App entry point and configuration
course_details_screen.dart - Main screen with clean state management

📊 Data Layer:

models/course_model.dart - Course data structure
data/course_data.dart - Static course data
services/cart_service.dart - Cart functionality (Singleton pattern)

🎨 UI Components:

widgets/custom_app_bar.dart - Reusable app bar
widgets/course_image_widget.dart - Course image display
widgets/status_badge.dart - Status indicator
widgets/course_info_widget.dart - Course details display
widgets/action_buttons.dart - Add to cart & buy now buttons
widgets/filter_chip_widget.dart - Filter selection chips
widgets/course_card.dart - Individual course cards
widgets/similar_courses_section.dart - Complete similar courses section

⚙️ Utilities:

utils/constants.dart - Colors, sizes, strings, and app constants

🚀 Key Benefits of This Structure:
1. Maintainability:

Each widget has a single responsibility
Easy to find and modify specific components
Clear separation of concerns

2. Reusability:

Widgets can be used across different screens
Constants prevent code duplication
Service layer can be shared app-wide

3. Scalability:

Easy to add new features
Simple to extend existing functionality
Clean architecture for team development

4. Testing:

Each component can be tested independently
Mock services easily
Clear dependencies
